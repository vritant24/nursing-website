                    This study is designed to survey registered nurses within the State of Indiana about areas

                                ISNAP is a program that offers consultation, referral and monitoring 
                                for nurses whose practice is impaired or potentially impaired due to the use, 
                                abuse, or dependency on alcohol and other drugs. 
                                <br><br>
                                A referral to ISNAP may be made by the employer, Employee Assistance Plan (EAP), 
                                co-worker, family member, friend or THE NURSE THEMSELVES. The nurse who self 
                                reports will not face disciplinary action by the Indiana State Board of Nursing 
                                (ISBN) against her/his nursing license: unless there is a refusal to comply with 
                                the ISNAP monitoring agreement. However, if the Attorney General's (AG) Office 
                                is simultaneously pursuing a complaint, the AG's Office may refer it to the ISBN 
                                for further review.
