                    <p class="resources-sections-section-p">
                        ISNAP is a program that offers consultation, referral and monitoring for nurses whose practice is impaired or potentially impaired due to the use, abuse, or dependency on alcohol and other drugs. A referral to ISNAP may be made by the employer, Employee Assistance Plan (EAP), co-worker, family member, friend or THE NURSE THEMSELVES. The nurse who self reports will not face disciplinary action by the Indiana State Board of Nursing (ISBN) against her/his nursing license: unless there is a refusal to comply with the ISNAP monitoring agreement. However, if the Attorney General's (AG) Office is simultaneously pursuing a complaint, the AG's Office may refer it to the ISBN for further review.
