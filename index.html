                        Indiana State Nurses Assistance Program (ISNAP)
                    </h3>
                    <p class="resources-sections-section-p">
                        ISNAP is a program that offers consultation, referral and monitoring 
                        for nurses whose practice is impaired or potentially impaired due to the use, 
                        abuse, or dependency on alcohol and other drugs. 
                        A referral to ISNAP may be made by the employer, Employee Assistance Plan (EAP), 
                        co-worker, family member, friend or THE NURSE THEMSELVES. The nurse who self 
                        reports will not face disciplinary action by the Indiana State Board of Nursing 
                        (ISBN) against her/his nursing license: unless there is a refusal to comply with 
                        the ISNAP monitoring agreement. However, if the Attorney General's (AG) Office 
                        is simultaneously pursuing a complaint, the AG's Office may refer it to the ISBN 
                        for further review.

                        association of hundreds of local affiliates, state organizations and volunteers 
                        who work in your community to raise awareness and provide support and education 
                        that was not previously available to those in need.
